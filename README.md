# Architectural Kata Creator with Solver (v.01)

## Overview
The **Architectural Kata Creator with Solver** is an open-source tool designed to assist software architects in generating and refining architectural katas. This tool offers solutions that include trade-offs of architectural characteristics, component design, appropriate architectural styles, risk assessment and mitigation strategies, fitness functions, C4 code design, and cloud implementations.

## Key Features
- **Architectural Characteristics Analysis**: Define up to seven key architectural characteristics from a pre-defined set.
- **Component Design**: Identify and refine software components based on actor actions and system requirements.
- **Architectural Style Selection**: Use a star rating system to select the most suitable architectural style that aligns with identified characteristics.
- **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Assess risks across components and characteristics, providing mitigation strategies.
- **Fitness Functions and Code Design**: Implement fitness functions in pseudo-code and provide architecture as code outputs for various platforms.
- **Cloud Implementation Guidance**: Offer suggestions for cloud-based implementations, including service schemas and cost estimates.

## Usage
1. **Define the Kata**: Start with a captivating name and a concise problem statement.
2. **User and Role Definition**: Describe the types and numbers of system users and roles.
3. **High-Level Requirements**: Outline the systemâ€™s high-level functional and non-functional requirements.
4. **Additional Context**: Provide relevant business or market context that influences the architectural design.
5. **Budgeting**: Propose a realistic budget for the project.

## Getting Started
To get started, please refer to the following structured steps:
- **Architectural Characteristics**: Refer to `arch.txt` for definitions and select characteristics accordingly.
- **Component Design**: Design components based on system interactions and refine them to meet user requirements.
- **Architectural Style**: Use ratings from `stars.csv` to select an appropriate architectural style, providing reasons and trade-offs.
- **Risk Assessment**: Perform a risk assessment and suggest mitigation strategies. Provide fitness functions for governing architectural characteristics.
- **Architecture as Code**: If interested, request code formats for specific architecture description languages.

### Example Kata
- **Title**: Online Auction Expansion
- **Introduction**: An auction company wishes to expand their online presence nationally.
- **Users**: Includes auctioneers, bidders, and administrative staff, with scalability to hundreds of thousands of users.
- **Requirements**: Focus on real-time bidding capabilities, robust user authentication, and high transaction throughput.
- **Additional Context**: The company is facing increasing competition and needs a fast time-to-market.
- **Budget**: Approximately $200,000 for initial rollout.
