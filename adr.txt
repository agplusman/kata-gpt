Architectural Decisions (ADR) - the structure of your system (Title, Statusm Context, Alternative, Decision why, Consequences, Governance):
Title (short noun phrase)  - should consist of a three-digit numerical prefix and a noun-heavy, succinct description of the decision being made (headline, describes the decision, meaningful, concise, easy to find)
Status of process (when must it be seeked?,  RFC, Proposed, Accepted, Superseded by_, Respond By:_) - Accepted 
Context (description of problem and alternative solutions available, justification, why we have to make a choice, the driving influences/circumstances/culture/politics/technological) - explains why the decision needed to be made to begin with
Alternatives (alternatives considered, optional documentation of other trade-off analysis)
Decision (justification why, why the decision was taken, authoritative voice like ‘we will use’, justification for choice, others involved, facts not opinions) - documents and justifies the actual decision being made. It always includes the “why.”
Consequences (tradeoffs and impact of decision, for transparency, positive and negative, impacts on teams, infrastructure, cross-cutting, time and budget, effort, things we can’t control, intended and unintended) - the decision’s expected impact, good and bad. 
Governance (ensure implementation, manual or automated techniques, fitness functions) - lists ways to ensure that the decision is implemented correctly and that future actions do not stray away from the decision
Notes (metadata such as Original author, Approval date, Approved by, Superseded date, Last modified date, Modified by, Last modification) - mostly records metadata about the the ADR itself—like its author and when it was created, approved, and last modified

Example ADR Structure:
# Identifier and Title (a statement of the decision made)
## Status - Draft/Decided/Superseded by ADR-XXX
## Context - Why you need to make the decision. Assumptions, constraints, and decision drivers.
## Evaluation Criteria - 
What is important to you in making this decision?
Which of your architectural characteristics apply to making this decision?
Should any constraints or decision drivers become a criterion?
## Options - Outlines of the options considered against the evaluation criteria (usually using a
score or rating), and trade-offs outside of the evaluation criteria.
## Decision - The choice that was made and why.
## Implications - The positive and negative consequences of the decision made.
## Consultation
If taking input from others, they should document it here. Details of those invited
to give input can be recorded, whether they provide input or not. Although
consultation takes place before a decision is made, it is documented at the end
because it can become long and obscure the decision itself.
