Architectural Decisions (ADR) - the structure of your system:
Title (headline, describes the decision, meaningful, concise, easy to find) - should consist of a three-digit numerical prefix and a noun-heavy, succinct description of the decision being made
Status (of process: RFC, Proposed, Accepted, Superseded by_, Respond By:_) - Accepted 
Context (why we have to make a choice, the driving influences/circumstances/culture/politics/technological) - sexplains why the decision needed to be made to begin with
Alternatives (optional documentation of other trade-off analysis)
Decision (why the decision was taken, authoritative voice like ‘we will use’, justification for choice, others involved, facts not opinions) - documents and justifies the actual decision being made. It always includes the “why.”
Consequences (for transparency, positive and negative, impacts on teams, infrastructure, cross-cutting, time and budget, effort, things we can’t control, intended and unintended) - the decision’s expected impact, good and bad. 
Governance (ensure implementation, manual or automated techniques, fitness functions) - lists ways to ensure that the decision is implemented correctly and that future actions do not stray away from the decision
Notes (metadata such as Original author, Approval date, Approved by, Superseded date, Last modified date, Modified by, Last modification) - mostly records metadata about the the ADR itself—like its author and when it was created, approved, and last modified
File naming - 042-use-queues-between-the-trading-and-downstream-services.md
