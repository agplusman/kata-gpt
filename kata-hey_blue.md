About Hey Blue!

Our Mission
The Hey, Blue! initiative facilitates moments of meaningful connection between police officers and members of their community by offering intentional opportunities for individuals to meet and share positive experiences.   #HeyBlue

VISION

Inspired by the extraordinary acts of heroism displayed by both individual community members and first responders during 9/11, EcoSchool co-founder, John Verdi, wanted to build a platform that could bring police officers and communities together with a shared purpose.

Connection-driven projects like Preschool Storytime and Selfies For Change are just the start of a larger movement designed to create an awareness of our shared humanity.

If police officers across the United States simply connected with 5 community members per day, the result would be 1.2 BILLION connections in a year.

Overview
												
Program Name: HeyBlue App/Platform												
Program Summary: The HeyBlue App Project is a sustained effort that facilitates moments of meaningful connection between police officers and members of their community by offering intentional opportunities for individuals to meet and share positive experiences. These positive interactions turn into points that the individual can use to purchase items and the police officer can donate to a non-profit or family in need.  #HeyBlue
											
Problem Statement #1: Connecting civilians and police officers for positive connections. 												
Problem Statement #2: Turning connections into points and exchanging those points for goods or to pay down municipal penalties (civilians) or donating them to nonprofits (police officers)											
Technology Solution Description: Application for connecting police officers and community through interactions and adding value to the connections..												
Tagline: Community. Connection. Change.
												
Users: 
	Individuals
Police Officers
Charities
	Retail Organization

Requirements:
The Platform must establish a way to incentivize and create connections between police and members of the community through selfies for change; the proof of concept for the mobile platform. However, Selfies are not required for the platform. Instead we simply want community members to approach and say Hello to an officer, while performing a virtual handshake. 
		
Web and Mobile-Based with back-end processing and reporting and analytics that tracks site activity, connections
Analytics can take app data and aggregate it with other available public data to build comprehensive reports to show impact of app in community
The ability for aggregated data to be automatically shared with local media outlets. 
End-Use Ease of Use is a hard requirement
Location Tracking is a Hard Requirement
Connecting with other users is a Hard Requirement

Allow Businesses/Charities to create a storefront on the app to encourage users to redeem or donate their points.
Businesses should have a catalog of items that they are offering and the point value assigned to each item available. 
Allow local municipalities to offer points for fines/fees in order to get citizens back on the road (suspended licenses or to pay down any municipal fine)
Users can only have one connection per officer per 24 hour period. (Hard requirement)
A connection can only happen if the community member and the police officer are within a 10 ft distance from each other,
Community members find the officers that are willing to connect, officers cannot find the community members.  (Hard Requirement)
A intrinsic reward system created (Think: confetti falling, bells and whistles happening, trophies awarded) We also uploaded a cool quote about connection to be used for each time a connection is made) (Hard Requirement)
Community members must link an email address to a particular phone and not be able to register multiple devices to a particular email address. (Hard Requirement)

 Business model: Affiliate marketing. 
EX:  User gets points for connection. User applies points for product i.e.: new shoes. Shoes before Hey, Blue! Points $100. Shoes after utilizing 10 Hey, Blue! points: $75 
User pays $75 of which Hey, Blue! Receives an affiliate marketing fee from retailer of 5% ($3.75)  
After admin costs: $1,   
$2.75 goes back into the community that participated (zip code) for connection events for more officer/ community connections, resources for the overall safety of the community (hire more officers for that particular zip code, etc. At the end of each month, users are notified via zip code of their participation and amount of money raised with an option for public input as to how the money will be spent. (Hey, Blue! Chooses 4 different ways to participants to vote)


Reminder to think critically about the civilian and officer experience, anticipate these users needs while developing the use case and user stories. Consider what can offer these users maximum value to fulfill the intent of logging on the app and turning on their location finder.
