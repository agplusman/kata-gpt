A “ghost kitchen” needs a system to allow users to have visibility of what items are available, purchase, and pick up items at any one of their points of sale.

Users: dozens of automated fridges and representative run kiosks, thousands of customers.
Requirements:
Must integrate with 3rd party smart fridges to obtain inventory and purchase activity
Smart Fridges accessible through the POS systems API’s.Produce item inventory levels and purchases. The smart fridges have a cloud based management system that handles communication with the Smart Fridge so obtaining this data would be through an API.
