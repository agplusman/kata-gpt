Performance - The amount of time it takes for the system to process a business request 
Responsiveness - The amount of time it takes to get a response to the user
Availability - The amount of uptime of a system; usually measured in 9's (e.g., 99.9%)
Fault tolerance - When fatal errors occur, other parts of the system continue to function
Scalability - A function of system capacity and growth over time; as the number of users or requests increase in the system, responsiveness, performance, and error rates remain constant 
Elasticity - The system is able to expand and respond quickly to unexpected or anticipated extreme loads (e.g., going from 20 to 250,000 users instantly)
Data integrity - The data across the system is correct and there is no data loss in the system
Data consistency - The data across the system is in sync and consistent across databases and tables
Adaptability - The ease in which a system can adapt to changes in environment and functionality
Concurrency - The ability of the system to process simultaneous requests, in most cases in the same order in which they were received; implied when scalability and elasticity are supported 
Interoperability - The ability of the system to interface and interact with other systems to complete a business request
Extensibility - The ease in which a system can be extended with additional features and functionality
Deployability - The amount of ceremony involved with releasing the software, the frequency in which releases occur, and the overall risk of deployment
Testability - The ease of and completeness of testing
Abstraction - The level at which parts of the system are isolated from other parts of the system (both internal and external system interactions)
Workflow - The ability of the system to manage complex workflows that require multiple parts (services) of the system to complete a business request
Configurability - The ability of the system to support multiple configurations, as well as support custom on-demand configurations and configuration updates
Recoverability - The ability of the system to start where it left off in the event of a system crash
Feasibility (implicit) - Taking into account timeframes, budgets, and developer skills when making architectural choices; tight timeframes and budgets make this a driving architectural characteristic
Security (implicit) - The ability of the system to restrict access to sensitive information or functionality
Maintainability (implicit) - The level of effort required to locate and apply changes to the system
Observability (implicit) - The ability of a system or a service to make available and stream metrics such as overall health, uptime, response times, performance, etc. 
For other Business Concerns:
